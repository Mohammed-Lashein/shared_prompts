# Shared prompts project
This project is from javascript mastery youtube channel, [link to the project on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5gMKuwSYk&t=1s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery)

## What is the need of this repo ?
There are a lot of repositories out there (including the repository containing the source code from the channel itself) so I am not sharing this just to clutter github with the same code . But instead, I created this repo for 2 reasons: 

1. Train myself on working on big projects (or at least not a todo app !) while commiting changes and developing small chunks of code . 
2. I write comments in the code extensively about new things introduced in the code from the video and wasn't explained in detail or wasn't explained at all , so here I write what I found after asking and reading here and there, so that I can save you some time or at least give you an idea of what a newly introduced code is doing .
